//we can generalize the function to make it reusable

function squareNum(num) {
  return num * num;
}

squareNum(10); // 100
squareNum(9); // 81
squareNum(8); // 64

//higher order functions follows the same principle

//we many not want to decide exactly what some ouf our functionality is until we run our function
